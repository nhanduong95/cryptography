These are the cipher texts in part 3 of the assignment.
1. File: msg1.enc, algorithm: Ceasar, key: unknown.
2. File: msg2.enc, algorithm: Columnar Transposition, key: unknown.
3. File: msg3.enc, algorithm: unknown, key: 23.
4. File: msg4.enc, algorithm: Random Substitution, key: unknown.
5. File: msg5.enc, algorithm: Vernam (addition), key: unknown.
    Hint: msg5.enc is related to message 2 in some way.
6. File: msg6.enc, algorithm: Columnar Transposition rst, then Ceasar, key: unknown,
    but same key for both encryption steps.
7. File: msg7.enc, algorithm: unknown but not Vernam, key: unknown.
